#Ubaryd

A color scheme for Vim with warm, Mediterranean-like, colours. Still a very much work in progress project,
feel free to pull request, hack, fork and do-whatever-you-want-with-it-as-long-as-you-give-credit.

#Credits

Many, many thanks to [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com) and his [Bad Wolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf)
that was of profound inspiration for this scheme. Without his work, Ubaryd wouldn't be born (and I'd still be 
using an ugly Vim theme...)
